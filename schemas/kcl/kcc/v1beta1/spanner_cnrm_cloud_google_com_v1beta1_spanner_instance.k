        APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
    kind : str, default is "SpannerInstance", required
        Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

    SpannerInstanceSpec defines the desired state of SpannerInstance

    ----------
    autoscalingConfig : SpannerCnrmCloudGoogleComV1beta1SpannerInstanceSpecAutoscalingConfig, default is Undefined, optional
        autoscaling config
    config : str, default is Undefined, required
        Immutable. The name of the instance's configuration (similar but not quite the same as a region) which defines the geographic placement and replication of your databases in this instance. It determines where your data is stored. Values are typically of the form 'regional-europe-west1' , 'us-central' etc. In order to obtain a valid list please consult the [Configuration section of the docs](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/instances).
    defaultBackupScheduleType : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Optional. Controls the default backup schedule behavior for new databases
        within the instance. By default, a backup schedule is created automatically
        when a new database is created in a new instance.

        Note that the `AUTOMATIC` value isn't permitted for free instances,
        as backups and backup schedules aren't supported for free instances.

        In the `GetInstance` or `ListInstances` response, if the value of
        `default_backup_schedule_type` isn't set, or set to `NONE`, Spanner doesn't
        create a default backup schedule for new databases in the instance.
    displayName : str, default is Undefined, required
        The descriptive name for this instance as it appears in UIs. Must be unique per project and between 4 and 30 characters in length.
    edition : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Optional. The `Edition` of the current instance. Currently accepted values are STANDARD, ENTERPRISE, ENTERPRISE_PLUS. If edition is unspecified, it has automatically upgraded to the lowest edition that matches your usage pattern.
    labels : {str:str}, default is Undefined, optional
        Cloud Labels are a flexible and lightweight mechanism for organizing cloud
        resources into groups that reflect a customer's organizational needs and
        deployment strategies. Cloud Labels can be used to filter collections of
        resources. They can be used to control how resource metrics are aggregated.
        And they can be used as arguments to policy management rules (e.g. route,
        firewall, load balancing, etc.).

          - Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long and must conform to
            the following regular expression: `[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,62}`.
          - Label values must be between 0 and 63 characters long and must conform
            to the regular expression `[a-z0-9_-]{0,63}`.
          - No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given resource.

        See https://goo.gl/xmQnxf for more information on and examples of labels.

        If you plan to use labels in your own code, please note that additional
        characters may be allowed in the future. And so you are advised to use an
        internal label representation, such as JSON, which doesn't rely upon
        specific characters being disallowed.  For example, representing labels
        as the string:  name + "_" + value  would prove problematic if we were to
        allow "_" in a future release.
