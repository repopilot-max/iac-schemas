        Immutable. An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when
        you create the resource. This field can be set only at resource
        creation time.
    ipCidrRange : str, default is Undefined, required
        The range of internal addresses that are owned by this subnetwork.
        Provide this property when you create the subnetwork. For example,
        10.0.0.0/8 or 192.168.0.0/16. Ranges must be unique and
        non-overlapping within a network. Only IPv4 is supported.
    ipv6AccessType : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The access type of IPv6 address this subnet holds. It's immutable and can only be specified during creation
        or the first time the subnet is updated into IPV4_IPV6 dual stack. If the ipv6_type is EXTERNAL then this subnet
        cannot enable direct path. Possible values: ["EXTERNAL", "INTERNAL"].

        log config

        network ref
    privateIpGoogleAccess : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        When enabled, VMs in this subnetwork without external IP addresses can
        access Google APIs and services by using Private Google Access.
    privateIpv6GoogleAccess : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The private IPv6 google access type for the VMs in this subnet.
    purpose : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. The purpose of the resource. This field can be either 'PRIVATE_RFC_1918', 'REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY', 'GLOBAL_MANAGED_PROXY', or 'PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT'.
        A subnet with purpose set to 'REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY' is a user-created subnetwork that is reserved for regional Envoy-based load balancers.
        A subnetwork in a given region with purpose set to 'GLOBAL_MANAGED_PROXY' is a proxy-only subnet and is shared between all the cross-regional Envoy-based load balancers.
        A subnetwork with purpose set to 'PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT' reserves the subnet for hosting a Private Service Connect published service.
        Note that 'REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY' is the preferred setting for all regional Envoy load balancers.
        If unspecified, the purpose defaults to 'PRIVATE_RFC_1918'.
    region : str, default is Undefined, required
        Immutable. The GCP region for this subnetwork.
    resourceID : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. Optional. The name of the resource. Used for creation and acquisition. When unset, the value of `metadata.name` is used as the default.
    role : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The role of subnetwork.
        Currently, this field is only used when 'purpose' is 'REGIONAL_MANAGED_PROXY'.
        The value can be set to 'ACTIVE' or 'BACKUP'.
        An 'ACTIVE' subnetwork is one that is currently being used for Envoy-based load balancers in a region.
        A 'BACKUP' subnetwork is one that is ready to be promoted to 'ACTIVE' or is currently draining. Possible values: ["ACTIVE", "BACKUP"].
    secondaryIpRange : [ComputeCnrmCloudGoogleComV1beta1ComputeSubnetworkSpecSecondaryIPRangeItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        secondary Ip range
    stackType : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The stack type for this subnet to identify whether the IPv6 feature is enabled or not.
        If not specified IPV4_ONLY will be used. Possible values: ["IPV4_ONLY", "IPV4_IPV6"].
