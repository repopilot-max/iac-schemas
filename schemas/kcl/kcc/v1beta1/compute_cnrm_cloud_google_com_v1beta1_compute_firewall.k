    allow : [ComputeCnrmCloudGoogleComV1beta1ComputeFirewallSpecAllowItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        The list of ALLOW rules specified by this firewall. Each rule
        specifies a protocol and port-range tuple that describes a permitted
        connection.
    deny : [ComputeCnrmCloudGoogleComV1beta1ComputeFirewallSpecDenyItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        The list of DENY rules specified by this firewall. Each rule specifies
        a protocol and port-range tuple that describes a denied connection.
    description : str, default is Undefined, optional
        An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when
        you create the resource.
    destinationRanges : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        If destination ranges are specified, the firewall will apply only to
        traffic that has destination IP address in these ranges. These ranges
        must be expressed in CIDR format. IPv4 or IPv6 ranges are supported.
    direction : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. Direction of traffic to which this firewall applies; default is
        INGRESS. Note: For INGRESS traffic, one of 'source_ranges',
        'source_tags' or 'source_service_accounts' is required. Possible values: ["INGRESS", "EGRESS"].
    disabled : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        Denotes whether the firewall rule is disabled, i.e not applied to the
        network it is associated with. When set to true, the firewall rule is
        not enforced and the network behaves as if it did not exist. If this
        is unspecified, the firewall rule will be enabled.
    enableLogging : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        DEPRECATED. Deprecated in favor of log_config. This field denotes whether to enable logging for a particular firewall rule. If logging is enabled, logs will be exported to Stackdriver.
    logConfig : ComputeCnrmCloudGoogleComV1beta1ComputeFirewallSpecLogConfig, default is Undefined, optional
        log config
    networkRef : ComputeCnrmCloudGoogleComV1beta1ComputeFirewallSpecNetworkRef, default is Undefined, required
        network ref
    priority : int, default is Undefined, optional
        Priority for this rule. This is an integer between 0 and 65535, both
        inclusive. When not specified, the value assumed is 1000. Relative
        priorities determine precedence of conflicting rules. Lower value of
        priority implies higher precedence (eg, a rule with priority 0 has
        higher precedence than a rule with priority 1). DENY rules take
        precedence over ALLOW rules having equal priority.
    resourceID : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. Optional. The name of the resource. Used for creation and acquisition. When unset, the value of `metadata.name` is used as the default.
    sourceRanges : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        If source ranges are specified, the firewall will apply only to
        traffic that has source IP address in these ranges. These ranges must
        be expressed in CIDR format. One or both of sourceRanges and
        sourceTags may be set. If both properties are set, the firewall will
        apply to traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the
        source IP that belongs to a tag listed in the sourceTags property. The
        connection does not need to match both properties for the firewall to
        apply. IPv4 or IPv6 ranges are supported. For INGRESS traffic, one of
        'source_ranges', 'source_tags' or 'source_service_accounts' is required.
    sourceServiceAccounts : [ComputeCnrmCloudGoogleComV1beta1ComputeFirewallSpecSourceServiceAccountsItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        source service accounts
    sourceTags : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        If source tags are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic
        with source IP that belongs to a tag listed in source tags. Source
        tags cannot be used to control traffic to an instance's external IP
        address. Because tags are associated with an instance, not an IP
        address. One or both of sourceRanges and sourceTags may be set. If
        both properties are set, the firewall will apply to traffic that has
        source IP address within sourceRanges OR the source IP that belongs to
        a tag listed in the sourceTags property. The connection does not need
        to match both properties for the firewall to apply. For INGRESS traffic,
        one of 'source_ranges', 'source_tags' or 'source_service_accounts' is required.
    targetServiceAccounts : [ComputeCnrmCloudGoogleComV1beta1ComputeFirewallSpecTargetServiceAccountsItems0], default is Undefined, optional
        target service accounts
    targetTags : [str], default is Undefined, optional
        A list of instance tags indicating sets of instances located in the
        network that may make network connections as specified in allowed[].
        If no targetTags are specified, the firewall rule applies to all
        instances on the specified network.
