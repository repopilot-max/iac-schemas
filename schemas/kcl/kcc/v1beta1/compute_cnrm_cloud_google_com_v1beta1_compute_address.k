    address : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. The static external IP address represented by this resource.
        The IP address must be inside the specified subnetwork,
        if any. Set by the API if undefined.
    addressType : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. The type of address to reserve.
        Note: if you set this argument's value as 'INTERNAL' you need to leave the 'network_tier' argument unset in that resource block. Default value: "EXTERNAL" Possible values: ["INTERNAL", "EXTERNAL"].
    description : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. An optional description of this resource.
    ipVersion : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. The IP Version that will be used by this address. The default value is 'IPV4'. Possible values: ["IPV4", "IPV6"].
    ipv6EndpointType : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. The endpoint type of this address, which should be VM or NETLB. This is
        used for deciding which type of endpoint this address can be used after
        the external IPv6 address reservation. Possible values: ["VM", "NETLB"].
    location : str, default is Undefined, required
        Location represents the geographical location of the ComputeAddress. Specify a region name or "global" for global resources. Reference: GCP definition of regions/zones (https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/)
    networkRef : ComputeCnrmCloudGoogleComV1beta1ComputeAddressSpecNetworkRef, default is Undefined, optional
        network ref
    networkTier : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. The networking tier used for configuring this address. If this field is not
        specified, it is assumed to be PREMIUM.
        This argument should not be used when configuring Internal addresses, because [network tier cannot be set for internal traffic; it's always Premium](https://cloud.google.com/network-tiers/docs/overview). Possible values: ["PREMIUM", "STANDARD"].
    prefixLength : int, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. The prefix length if the resource represents an IP range.
    purpose : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. The purpose of this resource, which can be one of the following values.

        * GCE_ENDPOINT for addresses that are used by VM instances, alias IP
        ranges, load balancers, and similar resources.

        * SHARED_LOADBALANCER_VIP for an address that can be used by multiple
        internal load balancers.

        * VPC_PEERING for addresses that are reserved for VPC peer networks.

        * IPSEC_INTERCONNECT for addresses created from a private IP range that
        are reserved for a VLAN attachment in an HA VPN over Cloud Interconnect
        configuration. These addresses are regional resources.

        * PRIVATE_SERVICE_CONNECT for a private network address that is used to
        configure Private Service Connect. Only global internal addresses can use
        this purpose.


        This should only be set when using an Internal address.
    resourceID : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Immutable. Optional. The name of the resource. Used for creation and acquisition. When unset, the value of `metadata.name` is used as the default.
