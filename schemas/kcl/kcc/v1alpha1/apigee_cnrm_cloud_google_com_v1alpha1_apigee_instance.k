You can provide just /22 or /28 or both (or neither). Ranges you provide should be freely available as part of a larger named range you have allocated to the Service Networking peering. If this parameter is not provided, Apigee automatically requests an available /22 and /28 CIDR block from Service Networking. Use the /22 CIDR block for configuring your firewall needs to allow traffic from Apigee. Input formats: `a.b.c.d/22` or `e.f.g.h/28` or `a.b.c.d/22,e.f.g.h/28`
