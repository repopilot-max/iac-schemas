    Attributes
    ----------
    createTime : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Output only. The timestamp at which this database was created. Databases created before 2016 do not populate create_time.
    earliestVersionTime : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Output only. The earliest timestamp at which older versions of the data can
         be read from the database. See [version_retention_period] above; this field
         is populated with `now - version_retention_period`.

         This value is continuously updated, and becomes stale the moment it is
         queried. If you are using this value to recover data, make sure to account
         for the time from the moment when the value is queried to the moment when
         you initiate the recovery.
    etag : str, default is Undefined, optional
        This checksum is computed by the server based on the value of other fields, and may be sent on update and delete requests to ensure the client has an up-to-date value before proceeding.
    keyPrefix : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Output only. The key_prefix for this database. This key_prefix is used, in
         combination with the project id ("<key prefix>~<project id>") to construct
         the application id that is returned from the Cloud Datastore APIs in Google
         App Engine first generation runtimes.

         This value may be empty in which case the appid to use for URL-encoded keys
         is the project_id (eg: foo instead of v~foo).
    uid : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Output only. The system-generated UUID4 for this Database.
    updateTime : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Output only. The timestamp at which this database was most recently updated. Note this only includes updates to the database resource and not data contained by the database.
    versionRetentionPeriod : str, default is Undefined, optional
        Output only. The period during which past versions of data are retained in
         the database.

         or [query][google.firestore.v1.ListDocumentsRequest.read_time] can specify
         a `read_time` within this window, and will read the state of the database
         at that time.

         If the PITR feature is enabled, the retention period is 7 days. Otherwise,
         the retention period is 1 hour.
